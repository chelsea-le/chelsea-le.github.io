Top of The Beats,"Using data from Spotify's API, this project allows users to search for their favorite artists' current tops tracks and stay up to date with the artists. Users not only can view how popular the songs are, but they can also see the album cover and listen to a preview of the track, all while being able to find related artists that they can check out.",http://students.washington.edu/chele510/info343/a5-spotify-chelsea-le/,"Spotify API & AJAX request, React & Materialize",beats.jpg,Nov-16,Chelsea Le
Tweeter,"A Twitter-like application that enables users to create an account and stream updates from others, as well as like each other's ""tweets"".

PocketDirections,"PocketDirections was created with the purpose of helping students, faculty, and visitors easily find their way around large places, such as the University of Washington. There are multitudes of platforms that exist and help individuals find directions to different locations, however, this only helps to a certain extent because users are then on their own to navigate their way inside. People still have difficulties navigating WITHIN buildings once they enter. With the research done at the time, only Google's Indoor Maps slightly resembled the idea my team had in creating a mobile indoor mapping app to provide users with a frictionless experience when navigating inside unfamiliar buildings, save their time, and decrease frustration. The design of our prototype used the University of Washington's campus as the mapping location, where users would ideally be able to find their way to a desired building and once inside, they would be provided with the building's floor plan and guided to the specific room. PocketDirections also took into consideration different accessibilities filters that users may require, such as choosing routes that avoided the staircase. Although, we did not actually implement the creation of the app due to the lack of resources, the purpose of this project was to use different elements of the design process (research, UX, UI, etc.) to create a prototype that would theoretically help solve a common social issue.",https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/EY7IBIYXG#/,"Wireframing, Design Thinking w/ UX & UI, Accessibility, & InVision App",pocketdirections.jpg,May-16,"Chelseas Le, Emraj Sidhu, Nicole Wood, Sophie Crane"
