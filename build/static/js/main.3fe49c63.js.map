This problem does not impact ASAP because Safari 6.0 supports\n\t// mutation observers, so that implementation is used instead.\n\t// However, if we ever elect to use timers in Safari, the prevalent work-around\n\t// is to add a scroll event listener that calls for a flush.\n\t\n\t// `setTimeout` does not call the passed callback if the delay is less than\n\t// approximately 7 in web workers in Firefox 8 through 18, and sometimes not\n\t// even then.\n\t\n\tfunction makeRequestCallFromTimer(callback) {\n\t    return function requestCall() {\n\t        // We dispatch a timeout with a specified delay of 0 for engines that\n\t        // can reliably accommodate that request. This will usually be snapped\n\t        // to a 4 milisecond delay, but once we're flushing, there's no delay\n\t        // between events.\n\t        var timeoutHandle = setTimeout(handleTimer, 0);\n\t        // However, since this timer gets frequently dropped in Firefox\n\t        // workers, we enlist an interval handle that will try to fire\n\t        // an event 20 times per second until it succeeds.\n\t        var intervalHandle = setInterval(handleTimer, 50);\n\t\n\t        function handleTimer() {\n\t            // Whichever timer succeeds will cancel both timers and\n\t            // execute the callback.\n\t            clearTimeout(timeoutHandle);\n\t            clearInterval(intervalHandle);\n\t            callback();\n\t        }\n\t    };\n\t}\n\t\n\t// This is for `asap.js` only.\n\t// Its name will be periodically randomized to break any code that depends on\n\t// its existence.\n\trawAsap.makeRequestCallFromTimer = makeRequestCallFromTimer;\n\t\n\t// ASAP was originally a nextTick shim included in Q. This was factored out\n\t// into this ASAP package. It was later adapted to RSVP which made further\n\t// amendments. These decisions, particularly to marginalize MessageChannel and\n\t// to capture the MutationObserver implementation in a closure, were integrated\n\t// back into ASAP proper.\n\t// https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js/blob/cddf7232546a9cf858524b75cde6f9edf72620a7/lib/rsvp/asap.js\n\t\n\t/* WEBPACK VAR INJECTION */}.call(exports, (function() { return this; }())))\n\n/***/ },\n/* 411 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t'use strict';\n\t\n\tObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n\t    value: true\n\t});\n\t\n\tvar _react = __webpack_require__(1);\n\t\n\tvar _react2 = _interopRequireDefault(_react);\n\t\n\tvar _Card = __webpack_require__(147);\n\t\n\tfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { default: obj }; }\n\t\n\t//component for about that will be passed into AboutPage\n\t//importing documents in to be used in this page\n\tvar About = _react2.default.createClass({\n\t    displayName: 'About',\n\t    render: function render() {\n\t        return (\n\t            //material-ui card\n\t            _react2.default.createElement(\n\t                'div',\n\t                null,\n\t                _react2.default.createElement(\n\t                    _Card.Card,\n\t                    { className: 'about-card' },\n\t                    _react2.default.createElement(_Card.CardTitle, { title: this.props.word, subtitle: this.props.explanation }),\n\t                    _react2.default.createElement(\n\t                        _Card.CardMedia,\n\t                        null,\n\t                        _react2.default.createElement('img', { src: 'imgs/' + this.props.image })\n\t                    )\n\t                )\n\t            )\n\t        );\n\t    }\n\t});\n\t\n\t//allows this page to be called(imported) by others\n\t\n\t//material-ui card components\n\texports.default = About;\n\n/***/ },\n/* 412 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t'use strict';\n\t\n\tObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n\t  value: true\n\t});\n\t\n\tvar _react = __webpack_require__(1);\n\t\n\tvar _react2 = _interopRequireDefault(_react);\n\t\n\t__webpack_require__(419);\n\t\n\tvar _About = __webpack_require__(411);\n\t\n\tvar _About2 = _interopRequireDefault(_About);\n\t\n\tvar _babyparse = __webpack_require__(124);\n\t\n\tvar _babyparse2 = _interopRequireDefault(_babyparse);\n\t\n\tvar _jquery = __webpack_require__(145);\n\t\n\tvar _jquery2 = _interopRequireDefault(_jquery);\n\t\n\tfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { default: obj }; }\n\t\n\t//main component for AboutPage where states are set and pieces from About.js is rendered\n\tvar AboutPage = _react2.default.createClass({\n\t  displayName: 'AboutPage',\n\t  getInitialState: function getInitialState() {\n\t    return { abouts: [] };\n\t  },\n\t\n\t\n\t  // When the component mounts, get (and parse) the data.

Lowercase jquery is used because AMD module names are\n// derived from file names, and jQuery is normally delivered in a lowercase\n// file name. Do this after creating the global so that if an AMD module wants\n// to call noConflict to hide this version of jQuery, it will work.\n\n// Note that for maximum portability, libraries that are not jQuery should\n// declare themselves as anonymous modules, and avoid setting a global if an\n// AMD loader is present. jQuery is a special case.
