# Portfolio

##Chelsea Le

-The purpose of this project was to create a portfolio by designing a multi-page website using React. My portfolio has the intentions of showing viewers a glimpse of who I am and what I care about, the projects I've worked on, as well as a document of my experiences and qualifications.

-I did a lot of self learning on this assignment with the assistance from W3 School, Stack Overflow, and the class exercise & modules. Jordan helped me for part of it when I couldn't render my passed data and the reason for this was because I wasn't calling it exactly the way I wrote the data (if capitalized, have to capitalized when calling property).

-Hours spent: I spent about 30+ hours on this assignment, but mainly because of styling and getting it to what I want it to look like so I can use the portfolio in the future potentially.

-The only main problem I encountered was when I was trying to render the data passed from my CSV file. It was called and passed properly and just didn't show up on screen only because my props was not calling the element by the exact name it was called in the CSV file. Capitalization matters in the way it was written in the data file and when it is called.
