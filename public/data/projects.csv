PocketDirections,"PocketDirections was created with the pupose of helping students, faculty, and visitors easily find their way around large places, such as the University of Washington. There are multitudes of platforms that exist and help individuals find directions to different locations, however, this only helps to a certain extent because users were then on their own to navigate their way inside. People still have difficulties navigating WITHIN buildings once they enter. With the research done at the time, only Google's Indoor Maps slightly resembled the idea my team had in creating a mobile indoor mapping app to provide users with a frictionless experience when navigating inside unfamiliar buildings, save their time, and decrease frustration. The design of our prototype used the University of Washington's campus as the mapping location, where users would ideally be able to find their way to a desired building and once inside, they would be provided with the building's floor plan and guided to the specific room. PocketDirections also took into consideration different accessibilities filters that users may require, such as choosing routes that avoided the staircase. Although, we did not actually implement the creation of the app due to the lack of resources, the purpose of this project was to use different elements of the design process (research, UX, UI, etc.) to create something that would theoretically help solve a common social issue.",https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/EY7IBIYXG#/,"Wireframing, Design Thinking w/ UX & UI, Accessibility",pocketdirections.jpg,16-May,"Chelseas Le, Emraj S, Nicole Wood, Sophie Crane"
