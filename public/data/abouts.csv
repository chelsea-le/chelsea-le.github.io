Diversity,"Diversity comes in many forms whether it deals with physical diversity or internal diversity. -Diversity of thought- consists of collaboration with a variety of people who have fresh perspectives and ways of thinking to reach a wider range of audiences. While the tech industry continually expands, the lack of diversity in this industry remains. By being involved in this community, I can be a part of the change.  The technology industry needs different minds to attain diversity of thought, but women and minorities must first feel they are in an inclusive, encouraging community. As a Chinese-Vietnamese American from a low-income family, my experiences, cultural values, and gender allow me to perceive the world uniquely. I will use my perspective and skills to empower, encourage, and foster the growth of vulnerable users through technology and collaboration.",diversity.jpg
Passion,"From the day my dad purchased an ancient Windows XP desktop, the world of information & technology opened up to me. At age six, I learned how to surf the web, created an email at seven, booked a plane ticket at nine, planned two funerals at sixteen, and helped my immigrant parents buy a house at eighteen. From my experiences and encounters, I have noticed that a large population of individuals cannot afford technology nor know how to adequately utilize it. Ultimately, I hope to use my desire to help others, passion to explore new cultures, and interest in technology to develop new ways to educate & assist vulnerable users gain access to affordable technology worldwide. I want to use new technological advances to launch more opportunities and one day make a difference by bridging the gap between families lacking imperative resources.",passion.jpg
Feed-Forward,"I strongly believe in the idea of feed-forward, instead of feedback because mistakes happen, but the best way to grow from them is to learn from it. A big part of this -learning- is determined by our attitude. Criticism comes with the territory when mistakes are made, however, the way people respond to it is vital. I take criticism as the best way for me to view new perspectives and see how I can move forward and change what I am doing to improve it. Sometimes we miss things or may be blinded by some attributes of an idea, thus, feed-forward helps enhance future actions taken.",feedforward.jpg
Ambitions,"I push myself and strive to do the best I can by putting 100% of effort into everything I do, regardless of the obstacles that stand in the way. From it, I have learned that hard work pays off and makes it easier accomplish things when you have passion and ambitions. I believe that passion can give you something to look forward to and be interested in, however, without ambitions, those passions will not go far. Having a great work ethic helps guide these ambitions. With ambitions, determination and motivation can be acquired. All of these things together can conquered it. ",ambition.png
Leadership,"At some point, all leaders were once followers, but great leaders are those who go the extra mile and do something worth remembering. Leadership is gained throughout life by stepping up and being someone people use as an example. Great leaders are also those who acknowledge people around them and not use their leadership skills abusively, but instead collaboratively to increase success for the whole entire team.",leadership.jpg
Innovation,"From experience, curiosity has been my innovative secret weapon. By asking questions and trying to figure out the unknown, new ideas have grown and old ones have been embellished. By differentiating something old with something new, curiosity drives the world forward. In fact, all great new innovations start with some sort of question, some trial and error, and a lot of research. From there, the rest can be history and new ideas can transform the future.

Change,"Participating in philanthropy and giving back to the community is very important to me. Without the community around me and all the resources that have assisted me along the way, I would not have made it to where I am today. Thus, I firmly believe in the idea of paying it forward and helping others. The littlest things we do can make the biggest change in the lives of others whether we know it or not. Therefore, what we do, build, create, and/ or promote with our skills and voice can either have a huge positive or negative social impact on the world. ",change.png
Values,"My family, education, and future are things I highly value. I am fortunate enough to be surrounded by supportive people that push me to strive for the impossible and live in a world where I can attend a great university that allows me to test the limits. For this reason, integrity is what allows me to prioritize these things above everything else. It is important to be honest to yourself AND others around you. Once you understand what your true values and motives are, it makes it easier to externally align values within various communities.",uw.jpg
